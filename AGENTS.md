## Pull requests

- Open every PR with `.claude/skills/open-pr/SKILL.md` and land it with `.claude/skills/land-pr/SKILL.md`. Read the full skill before use.
- The PR body has five fixed sections: Problem, Change, Proof, Review, Merge danger. Merge danger names the door and the blast radius.
- The open-pr gate and the `pr-kit` CI check refuse a body that breaks the contract. Fix the body. Never route around either.
